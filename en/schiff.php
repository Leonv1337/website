Europe-wide we link and connect motivated young people and show them how important it is to come up with a plan for a humane asylum policy. A ship is no long term solution.

By the 10th of March 2012 I fled to Egypt. I had to avoid being conscripted by the Syrian governments army. I knew that I would have to kill people there and that is something I am not willing to do. Yet life in Egypt was not easy. I had to work for small wages and every day was a fight for survival. And it was not going to get better in the future. The life in Egypt is not easy for the Syrians, yet also the Egyptians. Therefore the boat to Europe was my only way out."</p>

                        <p>In 2014, 218.000 People have fled via the Mediterranean and sought refuge. 3500 people did not survive their journey.</p>

                            <p>The rate of failure is high. In 2015 there should be between 500,000 to 1 million people daring to escape via the Mediterranean, according to Frontex. The central Mediterranean remain the most important escape route. It starts from Libya and ends in Lampedusa, Malta or Sardinia and has been used by 78% of the refugees in 2014. This huge number is the result of the closed European external borders and embassies that permit only the illegal and hence dangerous entrance into Europe as the last option.

Every 4th young person is eager to participate in concrete projects in the city or community of his/her. As of now, there has not been a comparable Youth Organization with the objective of conducting private rescue missions in the Mediterranean. Concrete independent initiatives for young people, through which one can express and exercise political will and determination, (<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/schulspiegel/leben/kinderhilfswerk-umfrage-kinder-wuerden-sich-gern-staerker-engagieren-a-890245.html">SPIEGEL Online, März 2013</a>). Aktuell gibt es keine vergleichbare von Jugendlichen initiierte Organisation mit dem Ziel der privaten Seenotrettung auf dem Mittelmeer. Konkrete, unabhängige Aktionsfelder für junge Erwachsene fehlen häufig, wodurch der Wille, sich politisch zu engagieren, oft nicht umgesetzt werden kann.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Since october, we're inspecting ships of our desired kind, the dutch fishtrawler. Once we buy the ship, the following technical specifications are of importance:</p><br>
                        <img src="../graphics/theship.svg" alt="Schiffsbesuch in den Niederlanden" style="max-width:100%"><br>
                        <ul>
                          <li>&#10003; Our ship must have a big loading space on deck. That way we can take 80-100 people aboard. Above the deck space, a truck plane will be hanged, to protect the people from sun or rain. In winter this plane will be fixed on the sides, through which a closed interior is gained. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src="../images/nl1.jpg" alt="Schiffsbesuch in den Niederlanden" style="max-width:100%"><br>
                        <ul>
                          <li>&#10003; Our ship is ought to have a low ceiling. That eases bringing people on board, as well as lower our tenders into the water. </li>
                          <li>&#10003; On deck a hydraulic crane will be installed, which can lower the tenders to water fast. We will have two tenders aboard. A ship in sea distress can be helped faster that way. Also, a possible panic aboard the distressed ship avoided. This might occur, when only one tender - with too less space for everyone - would verge. </li>
                          <li>&#10003; Our ship has to have enough space for fresh water tanks. Some people in distress will have spent several days without drinking water on their boat. To alleviate possible dehydration, the people are to be supplied with fresh water. </li>
                        </ul>
